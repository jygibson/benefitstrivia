Benefits Trivia

This is homework assignment number five for the coding boot camp, to create a trivia quiz. I tried to use this quiz to relate to my current job and create a fun interactive benefits quiz for our employees. The idea being that they would take the quiz, determine what benefits they understand the least, and could then improve their knowledge on that feature. 

This quiz was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery.
